        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup honey</li>
            <li>3/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup keychup</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>additional sesame seeds for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees. Cut chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>In seperate bowls, place cornstartch and slightly beaten eggs. Dip chicken into cornstarch then coat in egg mixture. I have also found that you can put the chicken pieces in a gallon size bag and shake to coat.</li>
            <li>Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken until browned. Place the chicken in a 9 x 13 greased baking dish.</li>
            <li>In a medium sized mixing bowl, combine honey, soy sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, vinegar, sesame oil, minced garlic, and cornstarch. Pour over chicken and bake for 45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Stir the chicken every 15 minutes so that it is coated in the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Enjoy!!</strong></p>
